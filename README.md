<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of iLosserPackageRepository is to consistantly transform text
in R. This package offers functions that convert text, column names, and
row names to snake_case. Also included in this package is theme_GGreen,
a retro-style ggplot2 theme. This is inspired by the classic Snake game.

## Installation

You can install the development version of iLosserPackageRepository from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("iLosser/iLosserPackageRepository")
```
