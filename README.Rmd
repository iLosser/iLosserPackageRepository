<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of iLosserPackageRepository is to consistantly transform text in R. This package offers functions that convert text, column names, and row names to snake_case. Also included in this package is theme_GGreen, a retro-style ggplot2 theme. This is inspired by the classic Snake game.
